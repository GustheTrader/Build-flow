# SMB Construction & Service Business Software Ecosystem Integration Research Plan

## Research Objective
Research the current SMB software ecosystem for construction and service businesses to identify popular tools that need integration, analyze integration challenges and opportunities, and create a comprehensive integration roadmap showing how to augment existing workflows rather than replace them.
